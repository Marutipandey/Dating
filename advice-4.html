            <p class="gray-clr">Dating chemistry. Everyone says it’s important, but what exactly is it, and what are the signs of chemistry? Put simply, dating chemistry is the connection between two people. It can be physical (we’ve all met someone we really wanted immediately upon meeting) or emotional (conversations with them feel like talking with an old friend) or a combination of both. The chemistry you share with a person is one of the most important parts of dating.</p>

            <p class="gray-clr">
              When it comes to dating, chemistry is super important, perhaps even more so than compatibility, at the beginning at least. Here’s why:</p>

            <strong>GOOD CHEMISTRY CREATES A POSITIVE FEEDBACK LOOP</strong> 
          </div>
          <div class="edit-page-intro">
            <p class="gray-clr">
              When you have strong chemistry with someone, the positive feelings you create in one and other build off each other, creating a positive feedback loop. The longer this loop is allowed to continue, the better you both feel.</p>

            <strong>DATING CHEMISTRY MAKES A RELATIONSHIP EXCITING</strong> 
          </div>
          <div class="edit-page-intro">
            <p class="gray-clr">
              We’ve all been there – those relationships with someone who’s perfect on paper, except there’s absolutely no spark. While compatibility is essential, a relationship with no chemistry is about as exciting as watching paint dry.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="msg-content-intro ">
            <strong>CHEMISTRY IS A FOUNDATION FOR MORE.</strong> 
          </div>
          <div class="edit-page-intro">
            <p class="gray-clr">
              The thing about long-term relationships is that they need both chemistry and compatibility to survive. Unless you have chemistry with someone, it’s difficult to find the motivation to date them long enough to see if you are compatible with them long-term.</p>

            <strong>WHAT DOES DATING CHEMISTRY MEAN, EXACTLY?</strong> 
          </div>
          <div class="edit-page-intro">
            <p class="gray-clr">
              According to researcher Helen Fisher, author of Anatomy of Love: A Natural History of Mating, Marriage and Why We Stray, love can be broken down into three stages – lust, attraction, and attachment, and your body reacts differently in each one. In the lust and attraction stages, the body is in control, with pleasure- and excitement-related hormones like dopamine, adrenaline and cortisol, which affect your physical reactions. During the attachment stage, however, dopamine gives way to oxytocin and vasopressin, hormones that are thought to promote bonding. So, chemistry is exactly that – biochemistry.</p>

            <strong>YOU BEING COMFORTABLE BEING YOURSELF</strong> 
          </div>
          <div class="edit-page-intro">
            <p class="gray-clr">
              Let’s face it, the first few dates are a little like an extended job interview. You’re both on your best behavior while trying to figure out if the other person is a good fit. If the dating chemistry is intense, though, it feels less like an interview and more like a series of conversations with a friend. You feel free to talk about things you might not otherwise, like your affection for 90s pop or your fear of My Little Ponies.</p>

            <strong>YOU BEING HYPER AWARE OF TOUCH</strong> 
          </div>
          <div class="edit-page-intro">
            <p class="gray-clr">
              Sexual attraction is often a big component of dating chemistry and feeling like you can’t keep your hands off each other is a big sign. When you have that spark with someone, you’ll get a rush from touching them, whether by accident or on purpose. If you find excuses to have your hand graze their arm as you pass, or playfully touch them in the middle of a conversation, and it gives you a rush – that’s one of the major signs of chemistry.</p>
          </div> 
           <div class="msg-content-intro ">
            <strong>YOUR BODY RESPONDING TO THEM</strong> 
          </div>
          <div class="edit-page-intro">
            <p class="gray-clr">
              Sometimes, your body knows before your brain does. When you have intense dating chemistry with someone, your body responds in certain ways – fore instance eye contact is easy, or you find yourself unconsciously leaning forward or mirroring your partner. It’s also really easy to picture yourself hugging or kissing them, or even more, and that’s a sure sign you have chemistry with someone.</p>
